## Problem
Create a Calculator without using built in libraries and create your own functions that perform the actions in which libraries would normally take care of.
- [+] For Addition
- [-] For Subtraction
- [/] For Division
- [*] For Multiplication
- [^] The first number you enter will be to the power of the second number you enter
- [e] The first number you enter will be to the power of e
- [!] For the factorial of any integer
- [r] For any random number between two integers entered
- [s] To calculate the sum consecutive integers between two given integers
- [~] To round to the nearest integer given any decimal value
- [<] Determine the lesser of two values entered
- [>] Determine the greater of two values entered
